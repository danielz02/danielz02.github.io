I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the [MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS)](https://idss.mit.edu/), advised by Prof. [Sherrie Wang](https://sherriewang.github.io/). I'm part of the [Earth Intelligence Lab](https://sites.mit.edu/earthintelligence/), where we try to democratize the access to geospatial machine learning and better understand our planet.

Before that, I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Bo Li](https://aisecure.github.io/), Prof. [Kaiyu Guan](http://faculty.nres.illinois.edu/~kaiyuguan/), and Prof. [Sheng Wang](https://shengwang12.github.io/). I also worked closely with Prof. [Zhangyang "Atlas" Wang](https://vita-group.github.io/).

My long-term research agenda aims to build _accurate, efficient, trustworthy, and democratized_ machine learning systems for climate and geospatial science. Concretely, I believe such systems should

- offer robust and generalizable spatiotemporal representations of Earth;
- achieve data efficiency with minimal computational overhead;
- uphold trustworthiness, minimizing risks of misuse;
- lower the barriers of entry to geospatial data, enabling their use by policymakers and the broader community.

In pursuit of this objective, I leverage the advancements in vision/language pretraining, benchmark design, model auditing, and domain knowledge augmentation, to improve the machine learning systems for geospatial data, particularly focusing on remote sensing images acquired from aerial or satellite platforms. By tailoring these methodologies to the unique challenges of geospatial data, I hope we can address the pressing issues in sustainable agriculture, land management, and agroecosystem modeling, thereby contributing to our collective efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change.
