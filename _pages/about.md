I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the [MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS)](https://idss.mit.edu/), advised by Prof. [Sherrie Wang](https://sherriewang.github.io/). I'm part of the [Earth Intelligence Lab](https://sites.mit.edu/earthintelligence/), where we try to democratize the access to geospatial machine learning and better understand our planet.

Before that, I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Bo Li](https://aisecure.github.io/), Prof. [Kaiyu Guan](http://faculty.nres.illinois.edu/~kaiyuguan/), and Prof. [Sheng Wang](https://shengwang12.github.io/). I also worked closely with Prof. [Zhangyang "Atlas" Wang](https://vita-group.github.io/).

My long-term research agenda aims to build _accurate, efficient, trustworthy, and democratized_ machine learning systems for climate and geospatial science. In pursuit of this objective, I leverage the advancements in _vision/language pretraining, benchmark design, model auditing, and domain knowledge augmentation_, to improve the machine learning systems for geospatial data, in particular aerial and satellite remote sensing images. By tailoring these methodologies to the unique challenges of geospatial data, I hope we can address the pressing issues in _sustainable agriculture, land management, and agroecosystem modeling_, thereby contributing to our collective efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change.
