I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at the MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS), advised by Prof. [Sherrie Wang](https://sites.mit.edu/earthintelligence/). I am interested in building accurate, efficient, and trustworthy machine learning systems for climate and geospatial science.

Before that, I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Bo Li](https://aisecure.github.io/), Prof. [Kaiyu Guan](http://faculty.nres.illinois.edu/~kaiyuguan/), and Prof. [Sheng Wang](https://shengwang12.github.io/). I also worked closely with Prof. [Atlas Wang](https://vita-group.github.io/).
